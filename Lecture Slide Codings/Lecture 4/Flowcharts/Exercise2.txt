You start by initializing the sum variable to 0 and a counter variable to 1.
You enter a loop that continues as long as the counter is less than or equal to 10.
Inside the loop:
	Read a number from the keyboard.
	Add the read number to the current sum.
	Increment the counter by 1.
After the loop completes (when the counter becomes greater than 10), you display the calculated sum.
The flowchart ends.
