You start by initializing the sum variable to 0, a counter variable to 1, and an average variable to 0.
You enter a loop that continues as long as the counter is less than or equal to 10.
Inside the loop:
	Read a number from the keyboard.
	Add the read number to the current sum.
	Increment the counter by 1.
After the loop completes (when the counter becomes greater than 10), you calculate the average by dividing the sum by 10 (since you've read 10 numbers).
You display the calculated average.
The flowchart ends.
